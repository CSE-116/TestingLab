# Lab 2

**Testing Lab**
This lab will primarily focus on testing. In this lab, you are given methods that have little to no functionality. Your mission is to NOT implement the methods, but to simply write tests for them. At the end of the lab, you may copy and paste the correct solutions and see if your tests are correct. The solutions along with sample tests are provided in [https://github.com/CSE-116/TestingLabSolutions]. Method 1 tests will be provided for you so that you can get an idea of how test driven development is handled. 

 

**Method 1: IncreasingLinkedListNode-**
This method takes in an ArrayList of type Integer and returns a LinkedListNode of type Integer. That LinkedListNode will be returned will reference the head node of the LinkedList. The ArrayList contains integers in an unsorted order. The LinkedList will store all the values inside the ArrayList as well as sort them in increasing order. If the ArrayList is empty, the method will return null. 

 

**Method 2: UniqueElementsInArrayList-**
This method takes in an ArrayList of type Interger and returns an int. This method will return the number of unique elements in the ArrayList. If the ArrayList is empty, the method will return 0. 

 

**Method 3: UniqueValuesInHashMap-**
This method takes in a HashMap of type String, Integer and returns an int. This method will return the number of unique values in the HashMap. If the HashMap is empty, the method will return 0. 

 

**Method 4: OneNodeLinkedList-**
This method takes in a LinkedListNode of type String and returns a boolean. This method checks to see if the LinkedListNode is the only node in the LinkedList. If so, the method will return true. Otherwise, the method will return false. If the LinkedList is empty, the method will return true. 

 

**Method 5: AverageOfLinkedList-**
This method will take in a LinkedListNode of type Integer and return a double. The method will return the average of all the values of the LinkedList. If the LinkedListNode is empty, return 0.
